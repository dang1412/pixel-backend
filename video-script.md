# Pixelland Video

Pixelland is a simplified 2D Metaverse gaming world, where its map is made up of a grid of tiles 100x100 NFT Pixels.
Pixel owners can advertise anything by putting images on their pixels.

Each Pixel is divided into further 10x10 or 100 sub-pixels inside it.
For example, a 2x2 image on the main map will contain a 20x20 submap.

We click on the image to open the sub-map, pixel owner can put more images inside.

To be a pixels owner, log in using Polkadot js or Subwallet app.
Select an area of empty pixels, click Mint, and confirm the transaction.
Select minted pixels, click Image button to choose one, and confirm it appears in the selection area.
Input the link, product name, and description, click save, and confirm the transaction again.

Now we have an image on the map, click to go inside it and repeat to put more images on the sub-map.

So we consider this a super simple version of a metaverse, where users own lands in the metaverse world and can build things on their land.
The next step is to create activities to attract more visitors to this world. To do so, we are building games.

## Lottery

The first game is the lottery game.
Users join by picking any sub-pixel they want, paying 1$ for each sub-pixel, and most of this fee goes to the total reward.

We select an area on a sub-map. Click pick. Confirm the transaction.
Then, we can see the total reward increases.

At the end of a round, there will be 1 winning sub-pixel.
Players who picked the winning sub-pixel get the first prize (70%), players who picked the pixel containing winning sub-pixel get the second prize (25%).
The remaining go to tax, pixel owner. 
The remaining reward adds up to the next round if there is no winner.

The reward is divided equally between all the winners, so it is likely that players will go to places that have less picked.

## Adventure

Players mint beast NFTs and bring their pets to the match on the main map.

Beasts will start at the central land, move around to fight each other, collect items, or enter other lands.

This is a turn-based game where players decide the next move for their beasts in a period before all actions are executed in order.

There are two types of action players have to choose in 1 turn: move or shoot.
Only the latest takes effect if two or more actions come from the same beast in 1 turn.

When the time comes (for example, after every 3 seconds), all the actions will be executed in order.
All move actions are performed before all shoot actions.
Hence, it becomes a mind game where players must guess the opponent's move and act accordingly.

When two beasts see each other and an item on the map.

If both decide to move to the item, only the faster one can move and get the item.
If one moves to the item, and the other shoots at the item position, the moved one is dead.
If one shoots at the item, the other shoots at the first one, then the first one is dead.
If both shoot at each other, then only the faster one can shoot, and the other is dead.

With the joining of multi-players and many beasts simultaneously, there will be countless exciting and unpredictable situations.
We are working to provide on-chain mode with paid and reward plans, and off-chain mode without an account which is free for users to experience and practice with friends and family.

We have a vision of a Metaverse with limitless activities and creativity, but we are starting very small and focusing much on quality and performance.
Welcome any feedback, and thanks for listening.
