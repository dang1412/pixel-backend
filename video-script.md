# Pixelland Video

Pixelland is a simplified 2D Metaverse gaming world, where its map is made up of a grid of tiles 100x100 NFT Pixels.
Pixel owners can advertise anything by putting images on their pixels.

Each Pixel is divided into further 10x10 or 100 sub-pixels inside it.
For example, a 2x2 image on the main map will contain a 20x20 submap inside it.

We click on the image to open the sub-map, pixel owner can put more images inside, on the sub-pixels.

So we consider this to be a super simple version of a metaverse, where users own lands in the metaverse world and can build things on their land.
The next step is making activities to attract more visits to this world. To do so we are building games.

## Lottery

The first game is the lottery game.
Users join by picking any sub-pixel they want, pay 1$ for each sub-pixel, and most of this fee go to the total reward.

We select an area on a sub-map. Click pick. Confirm the transaction.
Then we can see the total reward increases.

At the end there will be 1 winning sub-pixel. The pixel contains the winning sub-pixel is the winning pixel.
Players picked the winning sub-pixel get the first prize (70%), players picked the winning pixel get the second prize (25%).
The remaining go to tax, pixel owner. 
If there is no winner the remaining reward adds up to the next round.

The reward is divided equally between all the winners, so likely that players will go to place that have less picked.

## Adventure

Players mint beast NFTs and bring their pets to the match on the main map.

Beast will start at the central land, move around to fight others, collect items or enter other lands.

This is a turn-based game where players decide the next move for their pets in a period of time before all actions are executed in order.

There are 2 types of action player have to choose at 1 turn: move or shoot.
If 2 actions come from the same pet at 1 turn, only the later take effect.

when the time come (for example after every 3s), all the actions will be executed in order.
All move actions are executed before all shoot actions.
