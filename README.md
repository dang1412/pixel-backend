Pixelland is a simplified 2D Metaverse world combining advertisement and game.

Its 2D map is made up by a grid of tiles 100x100 NFT pixels, each pixel is divided into 10x10=100 sub-pixels inside it.
Pixels owner can advertise things by putting image with link on them, then it become a land and can put more images inside.
